## 📖 Abstract
Code clone detection is a critical task for software maintenance, plagiarism detection, and refactoring. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise, their computational cost is prohibitive for many real-time or resource-constrained environments. 

This work rigorously evaluates **small-scale transformer-based code models (<220M parameters)** to determine their efficacy in distinguishing clone pairs. We provide a unified evaluation framework across **five benchmark datasets**, offering insights into the trade-offs between model size, architecture (Encoder-only vs. Encoder-Decoder), and detection accuracy.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Unified Framework:** A single pipeline to evaluate six different architectures.
* **Diverse Benchmarks:** Pre-processed loaders for BigCloneBench, POJ104, and more.
* **Reproducibility:** Docker-ready scripts to replicate the exact numbers reported in the paper.
* **Extensibility:** Easily add new models or datasets to compare against our baselines.

## 📊 Models & Datasets

### 🧠 Code Models Evaluated
We focus on efficiency-oriented models suitable for standard GPUs:

| Model | Parameters | Architecture |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CodeBERT** | 125M | Encoder-only |
| **GraphCodeBERT** | 125M | Encoder-only (Data Flow) |
| **PLBART** | 140M | Encoder-Decoder |
| **PolyCoder** | 160M | Decoder-only |
| **UniXCoder** | ~200M | Unified (Enc-Dec) |
| **Salesforce T5** | 220M | Encoder-Decoder |

### 📂 Datasets
* **BigCloneBench:** Validated clone pairs from real-world open-source projects (Java).
* **CodeJam:** Google Code Jam competition submissions.
* **Karnalim:** Academic exercise-based code pairs.
* **POJ104:** Peking University student submissions (C++).
* **PoolC:** Diverse clone types from open-source projects.


## Prerequisites
* **OS:** Linux (Recommended) or Windows
* **Hardware:** CUDA-enabled GPU (8GB+ VRAM recommended)
* **Python:** Version 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10
